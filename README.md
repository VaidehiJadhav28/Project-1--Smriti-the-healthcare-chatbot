Smriti is a healthcare chatbot developed in python. The concept of NLTK is used for the creation and working of the chatbot. This project involves creating a conversational interface where users can describe symptoms or inquire about the chatbot. The bot assesses symptoms, offers advice, and emphasizes the importance of consulting a professional for accurate diagnoses. It's a simple yet interactive tool for basic health-related queries.

Breakdown of the code:

Imports: It imports the necessary modules (Chat and reflections) from NLTK's nltk.chat.util.

Functions:

greet(): Greets the user when called.
health_checker(): Handles the main functionality of the health assistant. It continuously prompts the user for options:
Option 1: Initiates a symptom checking conversation using predefined patterns and responses.
Option 2: Allows the user to ask questions about the chatbot. It engages in a conversation based on predefined pairs of questions and responses.
Option 3: Quits the program.

Execution:

If the script is run directly (if name == "main":), it calls health_checker() to start the assistant.
Pattern-Response Pairs:

symptom_pairs: Contains patterns and responses related to symptom checking.
bot_info_pairs: Contains patterns and responses for information about the chatbot.
Flow:

Upon execution, the program greets the user.
It presents options for symptom checking, asking questions, or quitting.
Based on the user's choice, it engages in conversation or quits accordingly.

Conversations:

The program uses the Chat class from NLTK to converse with the user using predefined patterns and responses.
Depending on the user's input, it matches patterns and generates appropriate responses.

Looping:

The program operates in a loop, allowing the user to select options until they choose to quit.

Farewell Meassages:

"Goodbye! Feel free to return if you have more questions." and "You're welcome! Remember, laughter is the best medicine. Take care! (type 'quit' to exit)" are the farewell massages included in the code.

Overall, the code presents a menu-driven health assistant that engages in conversations based on user choices, offering assistance with symptoms or providing information about the chatbot's capabilities.
